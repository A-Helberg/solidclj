  "Chrome-inspector-style paint flashing: any element whose attributes,
  text, or children just changed gets a brief blue outline.

  A MutationObserver watches the whole page. Flashing works by toggling
  between two identical CSS animations (`flash-a` / `flash-b`, see
  tailwind.css) — swapping the class restarts the animation for
  back-to-back changes without reflow tricks or timers. Mutations caused
  by the flash classes themselves are filtered out, so the observer
  never feeds back into itself.")

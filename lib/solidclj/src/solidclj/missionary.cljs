  "Bridges between Missionary (tasks & flows) and SolidJS reactivity.

  Suggested requires:

      (:require [missionary.core     :as m]
                [solidclj.missionary :as sm])

  Naming policy
  =============
  Missionary owns its vocabulary; we never reuse a `missionary.core`
  name to mean something else. Names deliberately AVOIDED here because
  missionary already defines them (b.47 var list):

    watch      ref → flow            (so flow → ref is NOT called watch)
    signal     shared continuous flow (so nothing here is called signal,
                                       even though Solid says \"signal\")
    subscribe  publisher subscription
    dispose!   publisher disposal     (ours is halt!)
    observe    callback → flow
    reduce / reductions / eduction / zip / sample / relieve / buffer
    attempt / absolve / compel       (task error plumbing)
    memo / stream / group-by / debounce / delay-each
    ? ?< ?> ?? ?= !                  (await/fork operators)

  `solidclj.api/?` predates this namespace and stays: it is the Solid
  analogue of `m/?` (\"await this reactive thing in the current scope\"),
  same meaning transposed, not an overwrite. Its flow machinery lives
  here (see `flow-getter`) so `solidclj.hiccup` does not require
  missionary directly.

  The API in one screen
  =====================
  Missionary → Solid:

    (sm/hold flow & opts)      flow  → read-only reactive ref (deref like s/atom)
    (sm/resource task & opts)  task  → read-only reactive ref, one-shot,
                               reloadable, suspends [:suspense] while pending
    (sm/spawn! task)           run a task under the current owner; cancel on cleanup

    accessors on hold/resource refs:
    (sm/pending? r)            reactive: no value yet?
    (sm/error r)               reactive: last failure, or nil
    (sm/reload! r)             resource only: re-run the task
    (sm/halt! r)               escape hatch: permanently stop a ref

  Solid → Missionary:

    (m/watch satom)            s/atoms are IWatchable — missionary's own
                               watch just works; we add nothing.
    (sm/tracked thunk)         Solid-tracked computation → continuous flow

  Hiccup story
  ============
  Flows are fns, so they are indistinguishable from render thunks in a
  child slot — the renderer does NOT auto-bridge them (same philosophy
  as plain atoms: nothing implicit). You always name the bridge:

      (defonce price (sm/hold (rpc/query 'ticker/price \"AAPL\")
                              :initial \"—\"))

      [:span \"AAPL: \" @price]                      ;; h macro wraps deref
      (fn [] (if (sm/pending? price) [spinner] [:p @price]))

  (`hold` is lazy, so a defonce like this costs nothing until a page
  renders it — see Lifecycle below.)

  Lifecycle (decided 2026-07-04)
  ==============================
  `hold` is LAZY and refcounted, Reagent-reaction style: calling `hold`
  runs nothing. The flow starts on the first reactive subscription
  (deref in a tracking scope, or add-watch), every subscriber counts,
  and when the last one is cleaned up the flow is cancelled. A later
  subscription restarts it from scratch. defonce holds are therefore
  safe: no SSE connection opens until the page that reads them
  renders, and navigating away closes it.

  `resource` is EAGER, matching createResource: the task starts when
  `resource` is called. Create resources in component bodies for
  fetch-on-render; cleanup of the owner cancels an in-flight task.

  `spawn!` is owner-tied: cancelled in onCleanup.

  Semantics shared by hold/resource refs
  ======================================
  - Satisfy IReactiveAtom + IDeref + IWatchable (NOT IReset/ISwap —
    read-only; writes belong to the flow). IWatchable means they also
    cross the React bridge as props.
  - Deref inside a tracking scope subscribes it, exactly like s/atom.
  - Reactive propagation dedups with CLJS `=` (same as s/atom).
  - On failure a hold keeps serving its last good value alongside the
    error (see `error`); a failed *resource* deref re-throws the error
    (createResource semantics — pair with [:error-boundary], or branch
    on (sm/error r) first). On normal flow completion a hold keeps the
    final value forever.
  - Discrete flows are consumed at Solid speed (synchronous transfer),
    which IS the backpressure — no implicit m/relieve; compose one
    yourself if the producer must not block."

    :initial  value returned by deref until the first emission

              mostly matters for discrete flows — see `pending?`)

  Lifecycle — lazy + refcounted (Reagent-reaction style):
  - Calling `hold` runs nothing. The flow starts on the first reactive
    subscription — deref/pending?/error inside a tracking scope, or
    add-watch (so React-bridge props count) — and is cancelled when the
    last subscriber is cleaned up.
  - Re-subscribing later restarts the flow FROM SCRATCH: value back to
    :initial, pending? true again. For SSE queries that is correct (a
    fresh :full snapshot); if remount flicker ever grates, a keep-alive
    grace period can be added later without changing this API.
  - Wart, inherited from Reagent reactions: deref outside any tracking
    scope while nothing is subscribed does NOT run the flow — it
    returns :initial or whatever the last run left behind. Stale by
    design; dev mode warns.

  Sharing: one active hold = one flow subscription. To share an
  upstream among several holds, share on the missionary side — and
  laziness makes that compose: (sm/hold (m/signal f)) starts and stops
  the shared publisher with the hold's own subscribers."

              or not, so under [:suspense] the fallback still shows.

  Eager like createResource: the task starts when `resource` is called.
  Create resources in component bodies (under a Solid owner): cleanup
  cancels an in-flight run, and `reload!` cancels it and re-runs the
  task (tasks are recipes — rerunning is free to express).

  Missionary cancellation is preserved: the task's cancel thunk is kept
  and invoked on owner cleanup, reload! and halt!, even though the
  promise handed to createResource cannot itself cancel — a deliberate
  cancel leaves the old promise unsettled rather than rejecting, so no
  transient error state leaks into the UI."

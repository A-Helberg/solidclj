(ns solidclj.hiccup-macros)

;;; Compile-time hiccup tree transform ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;
;;; The runtime walker (`as-element`) receives *values*, not source forms, so
;;; it cannot auto-wrap `(if ...)`, `(when ...)`, `(let [...] ...)` etc. in
;;; the `(fn [])` thunks that SolidJS needs to track reactive dependencies.
;;;
;;; This namespace provides a single macro `h` that walks the hiccup literal
;;; at compile time and inserts those thunks for you.  Plain `(fn [])` forms
;;; are left alone, so you can mix both styles freely — use `h` for the outer
;;; shape and add explicit thunks where you want fine-grained reactive scopes.
;;;
;;; Rules:
;;; - In child positions of a hiccup vector (after the tag and optional
;;;   props map), any list-form that does NOT start with `fn` or `fn*` is
;;;   wrapped as `(fn [] <form>)`. That includes `@a` — the reader turns
;;;   it into `(deref a)` — so bare derefs of reactive atoms are live.
;;; - In props-map values, `@a` / `(deref a)` forms are wrapped the same
;;;   way ({:value @a} → {:value (fn [] @a)}), except under `:ref` and
;;;   `:on*` keys, whose values are callbacks, not reactive reads. Other
;;;   list-forms in props are left alone (they're usually handlers).
;;; - Nested hiccup vectors are recursed into. Everything else (literals,
;;;   symbols, atoms) passes through unchanged — the runtime bridge in
;;;   `solidclj.hiccup` handles reactive atoms and other values.
